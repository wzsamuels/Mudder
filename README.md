YAM by W. Z.  Samuels

YAM (YAM is Almost a MUD client) is MUD client written in C# and using .NET. YAM is designed to 
be primarily used for social MUD's, but ideally it should be powerful enough for any purpose.

Features not yet working:
   Edit Menu -> Find doesn't do anything yet.
   Only one world can be saved at a time. Saving a new world will overwrite
   the previously saved world.
