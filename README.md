YAM by W. Z.  Samuels

YAM (YAM is Almost a MUD client) is MUD client written in C# and using .NET for the UI. Yam is designed to 
be primarily used on social MUD's, but it ought to be, powerful enough for 
RPG MUD's if desired.

Executables can be found at yam/yam/bin/Debug

Features not yet working:
   Edit Menu -> Find doesn't do anything yet.
   Only one world can be saved at a time. Saving a new world will overwrite
   the world one.

The author recommends using the DejaVu Sans Mono font available at:
http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Download 
The author is also fully aware that he may not have the best taste in fonts. 
This font will be used by default if installed, otherwise the default font will 
be Courier New. The font can be changed to any installed font by selecting 
Tools -> Change Font from the menu bar.
